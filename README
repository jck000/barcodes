This is my Perl 1D barcode library.  I wrote this years ago and haven't
really touched it since.  I do use it now and then when I need to print
barcodes.  The interfaces might not be consistent and definitely the
code needs cleaned up, but it works.  This includes code to create
*every* 1D barcode format that I could find.

Code128 (C128 - there was a Code128 module already)
Codabar
Code 3 of 9 (aka "Code 39" and "USD-3") and Code 93
Code 11
Coop 2 of 5
IATA 2 of 5 (aka "2 of 5" and "Industrial 2 of 5")
Interleaved 2 of 5 (aka "I 2/5" and "ITF")
Matrix 2 of 5
Standard 2 of 5
Plessey
PostNet
EAN-8 and EAN-13
UPC-A and UPC-E
UPC Supplemental 2 and UPC Supplemental 5


I've also left my sample "play" code in here in various Perl programs.
A test suite would be nice, as would consistency (as much as possible)
in the interfaces.

I have a few production applications which are spitting out bar codes
using this code on various forms to make automation easier.  I typically
use Code 128 nowadays as it's compact and easy, but Interleaved 2 of 5
or Code 3 of 9 are also good for some applications.

Any modern bar code scanner will read (at least) Code 128, Code 3 of 9
and 93, Codabar, EAN and UPC variants, and most 2 of 5 variants.
PostNet is rendered differently and as such is not readable by a
standard scanner.  Read the documentation for each before using one -
some are considered "legacy" and not recommended for general use.  They
are included here in case somebody needs to generate them.

Please note that the samples typically render PostScript, which I use
when printing.  You can also easily render using GD or even HTML tables,
depending on your application.  Note that PostScript files can easily be
opened on Mac OS X by simply double-clicking them.  On Linux, use "gv"
or "ghostview" to see them.  You can also install ghostview on a Mac
using MacPorts.
